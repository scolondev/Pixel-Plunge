# Pixel Plunge
A rogue-like dungeon crawler that was used to test many core concepts of future games I was creating.

I've fixed two bugs with the old version and it is now playable again, it is still very buggy as this is code from 2019 and it has been over a year since I've last messed around with this project.  This project is long abandoned, it's original scope was a mobile rogue-like dungeon crawler, that you would play on a daily basis as it would generate new dungeons for you everyday.

At the time, I did not have the skills to make this project live up to my expectations and it was consumed by my scope.

If you would like to use this code, please review the Terms of the Apache 2.0 License.  If you wish to download this code and start working on the project, you'll need to download a lot of Unity Packages.
