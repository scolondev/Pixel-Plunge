# Pixel Plunge
A rogue-like dungeon crawler that was used to test many core concepts of future games I was creating.  It was heavily inspired by games like the binding of isaac and enter the gungeon, as those games are a lot of fun.  Perhaps it'll be worth to get back into modding The Binding of Isaac...

I've fixed two bugs with the old version and it is now playable again, it is still very buggy as this is code from 2019 and it has been over a year since I've last messed around with this project.  I may fix the other issues later but for now it remains as a relic.
